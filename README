Tinted Window, by Euan J Hunter

A Hopefully Helpful Java Program

This program creates coloured overlays on screen, which can be useful for people with dyslexia.

Note: Unfortunately because of the changes in Java 7, this program does not work with Java 7 
at the moment.

Usage
When this program is run, a partially translucent window will appear with the default purple colour.
This window's size can be adjusted to suit. By right clicking on the window, a menu pops-up with 3
options. About brings up the about page, Options gives you varies options for changing the colour and
translucence of the window and Quit closes the program. Upon re-opening the window, the previously
selected colour and translucency are remembered. The window also is always infront of other windows,
so putting the overlay over a piece of text in your web browser and then clicking to the side of the
window on to the web browser allows the text to be scrolled with the overlay remaining in place.

Advanced
If you want to reset to values for colour and translucency, the file the saves the values is in one
of two places:
Window 7:
	C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Tinted Window\Tinted Window.dat
Search for %APPDATA% to find other windows version equivalents.

Anything other than Windows:
	.../YourUserName/.tintedwindow.dat
